1. Read the files from sequence0/frames
2. Sending each file through the canny edge detection
3. Make roi around the areas that are necessary. leave the rest.
4. Convert to greyscale
5. Apply thresholding
6. Apply blurring
7. using morphologyex gave better results
8. finding contours on the canny images
9. trying sobel to find the edges 

find the angles
filter the lines by the angles
find the midpoints of the lines 
combine the lines that are pairs
extend the lines i.e double them using midpoint theorem
find collinearity of the close lines
if collinear and close combine them into a long line


ALgo for the boxing.
--------------------------------------------
1.Choose the line with the least x value.

2.find the line below it and compare their lengths.
    if the length of either is smaller than 80 percent of the other, make it 80 percent of the other.


Using rotated rectangles
--------------------------------------------------
find the edges of the lines using the contours
find rotatedrectangles that fit inbetween these lines
sort them by area
