1. Read the files from sequence0/frames
2. Sending each file through the canny edge detection
3. Make roi around the areas that are necessary. leave the rest.
4. Convert to greyscale
5. Apply thresholding
6. Apply blurring
7. using morphologyex gave better results
8. finding contours on the canny images
9. trying sobel to find the edges 

find the angles
filter the lines by the angles
find the midpoints of the lines 
combine the lines that are pairs
extend the lines = double them using midpoint theorem
find collinearity of the lines
if collinear combine them into a long line
